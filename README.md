DETECTING EMERGING THREATS IN INJURY AND VIOLENCE USING NETWORK SCIENCE and MACHINE LEARNING  TECHNIQUES.

Suicide – Suicide is death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die; suicide attempt is when
someone harms themselves with any attempt to end their life, but they do not die as a result. Both
suicides and suicide attempts negatively affect the well-being of a person’s loved ones and an
individual can experience long-term health effects resulting from a suicide attempt. Suicide is the
10th leading cause of death in the U.S. In 2019, 12 million Americans thought about suicide, 3.5
million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.4 million attempted suicides. The cost to society from
suicide and suicide attempts is over $70 billion per year in lifetime medical and work-loss costs.
People of any age, race, ethnicity, or sex can experience suicide risk, but certain groups have
substantially higher rates of suicide than the general U.S. population including:
o Veterans
o People who live in rural areas
o Sexual and gender minorities
o Middle-aged adults
o Tribal populations

 I Appling  machine learning and network science skills to identify and characterize emerging health threats in the areas of suicide on Amercan societies.
